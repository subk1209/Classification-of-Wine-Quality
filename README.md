Classification of Quality of Wine using Multiple Logistic Regression

Executed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset with 12 attributes and nearly 5000 instances (used ggplot2 in R)
Removed pre‐existing multicollinearity in the dataset using VIF technique and fitted a Multiple Logistic Regression Model
Obtained the performance metrics: Accuracy of 71.32%, Precision of 84.81% and an F1‐Score of 76.26% on the test data
Plotted the ROC Curve and obtained an AUC‐Score of 0.789 by using the threshold probability 0.658
